Ticketflow ticketing system Web application

Ticketflow is an open source Coldfusion (Railio) Web application to allow users to write, edit, update, and close job tickets in an office setting, or just about anywhere else.

There are many detailed instructional documents included in this project that can be used to instruct users on how to create new tickets, edit existing tickets, and everything else the application can do. These instructional materials include email screen shots, and application screen shots as well.

Additionally, included in the project is a workflow diagram that explains to users how the application fits with their workflow and how the steps of the application are accomplished from start to finish.
